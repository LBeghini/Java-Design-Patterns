## Mediator

Mediator pattern defines an interface to communicate with other objects.

For example, let's say that we have to get a Defaut Gateway address from our router in order to communicate in the internet. A host computer does not directly communicates with the router. To do so, it needs to send requests throug protocols that will provide the proper answer. The request and protocol is our mediator to the router.
