## Visitor

Visitor pattern is a way to perform operations of a determinated structure build outside the structure. 

For example, let's say we have a Museum, and we want to see the masterpieces. However, the arts don't come with an exhibit method, and you don't have the rights to change anything inside the classes.

So you use the Museum as a Visitor to get the exhibitions of the masterpieces.
