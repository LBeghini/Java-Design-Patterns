## Interpreter

Interpreter pattern interprets sentences to match an desired expression type.

For example, let's say we want to validate logical expressions such as greather than, less than and equals. For that, we would write "6 > 3" or "3 < 7" or "2 = 2". However, those are strings, and they must be interpreted so the computer can understand.
