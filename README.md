## Chain of Responsibility

Chain of Responsibility method gives to one object the responsibility of dealing with a request. If this object is not responsible for that request, it will pass it foward until the end of the chain.

For example, when we go to a restaurant, we don't personally ask for the meal to the chef. We will ask the waiter, that will give the chef our request.
