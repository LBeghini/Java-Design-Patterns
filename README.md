# â˜• Java Design Patterns

## About

This application is a simple Java Console Application that aims to implement design pattern examples to a Programmin Language Class. A set of design patterns will be developed
each week, and they are divided in different [branches](https://github.com/LBeghini/Java-Design-Patterns/branches).  

The main branch is a template for every other branch.  

## Implemented design patterns
### Behavioural patterns
- [ ] Chain of responsability
- [ ] Command
- [ ] Iterator
- [ ] Memento
- [ ] Observer
- [ ] State
- [ ] Strategy
- [ ] Template method

### Creational patterns
- [ ] Abstract factory
- [x] [Builder](https://github.com/LBeghini/Java-Design-Patterns/tree/1-builder)
- [ ] Factory method
- [ ] Prototype
- [x] [Singleton](https://github.com/LBeghini/Java-Design-Patterns/tree/1-singleton)

### Structural patterns
- [ ] Adapter
- [ ] Bridge
- [ ] Composite
- [ ] Decorator
- [ ] Facade
- [ ] Flyweight
- [ ] Mediator
- [ ] Proxy

## Technologies

## Requirements 
To run and edit the project, be sure to have installed in your computer the following softwares:
- A code editor

After that, you'll need to clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/LBeghini/Java-Design-Patterns.git
```

## Change branch
To change to a different branch, run the command:
```bash
git checkout name-of-the-branch
```
The branch names have the pattern:

```
{number-of-the-week}-{pattern-name}
```
> `number-of-the-week` corresponds to the week asked to be implemented certain pattern 

## Testing
This project has no aim to run any of the implemented classes, as the goal is the code itself. However, the classes will be tested to visualize the behaviour and implementation 
of the patterns.  

You can run the tests using the maven wrapper:
```bash
./mvnw test 
```
