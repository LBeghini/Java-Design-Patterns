## Command

An artist is a person that makes lots of mistakes before succeed on his artwork. It's useful for him to be able to keep track of his improvements and undo it if necessary.

For example, if the artist is writing a book, he needs to be able to write, and undo it's last writing until he finds the best phrase to continue the history. So it can perform an action of write and cancel.
