## Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a pattern that provide an interafce to create objects that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.

For example, let's say we have a store that makes on demand mobiles: 
- chair 
- couch

There's two types of mobiles:
- wooden
- fabric

The store can be specialized on selling wooden mobiles or fabric mobiles, and depending on the specialty it will require a specific factory.
