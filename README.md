## Facade

Facade provides a simplified interface to whoever wants to using it, sparing the complexity it may have behind.

For example, let's say a customer wants if a loan is available to him. Then, he only asks to our interface facade if thats possible, and it will take care of all the rest, checking the bank account of the customer and its credit.
